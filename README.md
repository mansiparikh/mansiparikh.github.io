The 311 Service requests dataset contains all the 311 calls from 2010 to present with many different features including timestamps, location, service request descriptions, etc. The weather data contains the weather information from the weather stations in NYC from 2010 to present in daily intervals. (Note: I just used 2016 data from both data sets.) The final goal of this project is to predict the daily 311 inbound calls for the next 7 days, while evaluating the impact of weather on the call volume if any.
